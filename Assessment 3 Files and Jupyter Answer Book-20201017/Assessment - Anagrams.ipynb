    "# Overview\n",
    "This assessment requires you to create an application which can perform three activities.  The exact details of each activity will be explained in their own sub-sections.  This section will outline the primary high-level logic of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application will start by presenting a brief explanation of: \n",
    "* anagrams, palingrams and palindromes (Prerequisite knowledge), and\n",
    "* the three activities which can performed by the application (Activity A, Activity B, Activity C).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function with this initial explanation text is included in the provided function called ***print_explanation()***. The application should call this function to show the display in figure 1. \n",

The processes should call the appropriate functions/procedures within the appropriate logic structures.i.e if activity A is selected, only Activity A should be run.

    "This is a smaller version of the dictionary which you have the option of using to test functionality of the activities. You do not need to use it if you do not want to.

    "## Prerequisite knowledge for assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment will require you to find anagrams, palindromes, and palingrams. To do this you need to understand what they are. The below section presents a simple explanation of these concepts.\n",
    "### 1. Anagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "An anagram is a play on words created by rearranging the letters of the original word to make a new word or phrase. Anagram examples can be fun and witty, and they often end in hilarious results.\n",
    "Anagrams are often longer words or phrases that do not necessarily mean anything but are fun to come up with and say. There are also anagrams of simple words that create random, new words that are not relevant to one another.\n",
    "Single word anagram examples include:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Tar = Rat\n",
    "* Arc = Car\n",
    "* Elbow = Below\n",
    "* State = Taste\n",
    "* Cider = Cried\n",
    "* Dusty = Study\n",
    "* Night = Thing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more complex phrases which include multiple words; however, this assessment will focus on anagrams of single words found in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Palindromes\n",
    "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of words that reads the same backward as forward. Punctuation and spaces between the words or lettering is allowed. This assessment will focus on single word, and two-word palindromes.\n",
    "5\n",
    "Single word palindrome examples include:\n",
    "* anna\n",
    "* civic\n",
    "* kayak\n",
    "* level\n",
    "* madam\n",
    "* mom\n",
    "* noon\n",
    "* radar\n",
    "* redder\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Palingrams\n",
    "A palingram is a sentence in which the letters, syllables, or words read the same backward as they do forward. Multiple word palindromes (palingrams) include:\n",
    "* top spot\n",
    "* my gym\n",
    "* ala cicala\n"

    "# The Activity Explanations\n",
    "There are three activities in this assessments application. Activity A, Activity B and Activity C. The functionality for each of these will explained here. Read the descriptions carefully as variable names, function names, and logic hints are included in the explanations.\n",
    "\n",

    "The program prompts the user for their choice of a single word. \n",
    "\n",
    "The application must check that the user’s input is a word or alphabetical characters. It can not accept special characters or numbers. If the input is invalid the initial explanation and user prompting should be re-displayed. The application should not need to be restarted manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the user was correct, the application should display the message ***“Using word =”*** with the user’s input word added at the end. See figure 4, figure 5, and figure 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the sentence is displayed the application should use a combination of logic and the provided functions to find the anagrams of the provided words. The anagrams should be found by taking the user a word and searching the dictionary for anagrams of equal length for the word.  The application should compile a list of the anagrams if they exist. It should then print the list of anagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first item in the anagram list should always be the user’s word\n",
    "* All other items in the list should be sorted alphabetically (see figure 6)\n",

This code should not change if the function was called elsewhere and provided different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "After displaying the anagrams, the application should search the anagrams list for any palindromes. The application should compile a list of the palindromes if they exist in the list of anagrams. The list should include the word itself if it is a palindrome. The final part of this functionality should display the message:\n",
    "\n",
    "***“Number of palindromes found = “*** and the number of palindromes in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the list of palindromes is formed its contents should be displayed using the ***print_generic_list()*** function. If there are no palindromes the appropriate message should be displayed (see figure 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "After all the processing and the displaying of the information the entire result set should be written to file. The ***write_anagrams_palindromes_to_file()*** function should be used to accomplish the task.\n",
